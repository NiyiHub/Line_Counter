# Line_Counter
Line counter is a python script built for the purpose of counting lines of “text” based files.

# How It Works
To make use of this application, the user will move the python script to the folder the text file(s) is then run it from there.
The automation is carried in such a way that when the script is running, it locates any text-based files in the location you are running it from then execute the task.

# Prerequisites
Install Python 3.9
Install an IDE (PyCharm is a good recommendation)
